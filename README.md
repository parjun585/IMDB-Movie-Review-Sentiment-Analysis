# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This project is a **Sentiment Analysis** tool that predicts whether a given movie review is **positive** or **negative** based on a pre-trained SimpleRNN model. The model is trained on the IMDB movie review dataset and uses **Streamlit** to provide an interactive web interface for users to input movie reviews and get sentiment predictions.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with an embedding layer to perform binary classification on IMDB movie reviews. After training the model, it's saved and later loaded into a Streamlit application to allow users to input their own movie reviews and predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

## Features

- **Model Architecture**: SimpleRNN with an embedding layer and Dense layer for binary classification.
- **User Interaction**: Users can input movie reviews into a text box, and the application predicts the sentiment using the pre-trained model.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple and interactive web interface for sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- NumPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-imdb.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-imdb
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies**

   You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy
   ```

3. **Download and Save the Pre-trained Model**

   The model file `simpleRNN_IMDB_sentiment_Analysis_part_2.h5` should be downloaded and placed in the project directory. You can either train the model yourself or download a pre-trained version.

4. **Run the Streamlit Application**

   Launch the application with Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit.py
   ```

   This will open the application in your web browser where you can start testing the sentiment analysis on your movie reviews.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
├── streamlit.py                 # Main application file for Streamlit
├── simpleRNN_IMDB_sentiment_Analysis_part_2.h5   # Pre-trained model file
├── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
└── requirements.txt       # Dependencies required for the project
```

### Model Training

If you wish to train the model yourself, refer to the `simple rnn from scratch.ipyb` script (if included). The model is trained on the IMDB dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a brief overview of the training process:

1. **Load IMDB Dataset**: Download the dataset from TensorFlow Datasets.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Tokenize and pad the movie reviews to ensure uniform input size.
3. **Model Architecture**: SimpleRNN with Embedding layer followed by a Dense output layer with sigmoid activation.
4. **Compile and Train**: The model is compiled with `binary_crossentropy` loss and `adam` optimizer. It is trained for multiple epochs with early stopping.

### Usage

1. **Enter Movie Review**: Type or paste a movie review into the text box provided in the Streamlit web app.
2. **Analyze Sentiment**: Click the 'Analyze Sentiment' button to predict whether the review is positive or negative.
3. **View Results**: The predicted sentiment and confidence score are displayed on the page.

### Example

An example usage scenario might look like this:

- **Input**: "The movie was very exciting and the acting was superb."
- **Prediction**: Positive
- **Confidence Score**: 0.98
